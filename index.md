# Isabella Nicholas' Portfolio

I am a Computer Science major at Cal State Fullerton expecting to graduate with a CS degree in 2028. I hope that my time here will be benificial to my future career in the Tech world. 

## Favorite CPSC 120L labs
* Lab 1 - Hello world!
  This lab was the first form of code I had been introduced too. Although I didn’t complete it the right way, I still learned the uses of cout and cin after and realized my mistakes. The phrase “Hello World” will be embedded as a positive phrase directed to the start of my CS journey. 

* Lab 5 - Calculating the area of a rectangle Part 1
  Doing this lab was also an intorduction to the uses of numbers. It made my mind open up about all the different coded technology we have such as calculators. My partner and I were able to replicate that from a computer which made me feel proud and amazed.

* Lab 6 - Blackjack Part 2
  In my opinion, this lab was the most fun and frustrating at the same time. I was lucky enough to have a partner that helped me learn the correct uses for bool which helped for future labs. Learning everything in the moment was frustrating but figuring everything out in the end was the best feeling in the world.
